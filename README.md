# STM32f00xx Standard Peripheral Blink Sample

A simple blink HelloWorld style program for the STM32F0xx board (this works with the Nucleo demo board).

This code should be included/copied into a proper build environment for the STM32f0xx, e.g., the STM System Workbench.

This code uses the Standard Peripheral hardware libraries for the STM32F0 instead of using the HAL libraries generated by the STMCubeMx utility.
