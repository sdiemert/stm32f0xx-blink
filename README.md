# STM32f00xx Standard Peripheral Sample Code

A simple HelloWorld style programs for the STM32F0xx board (this works with the Nucleo demo board).

This code should be included/copied into a proper build environment for the STM32f0xx, e.g., the STM System Workbench.

This code uses the Standard Peripheral hardware libraries for the STM32F0 instead of using the HAL libraries generated by the STMCubeMx utility.

## Examples

- `blink.c` - blink the LED on and off at a fixed rate, the typical "hello world" of embedded systems.
- `button.c` - turn the light on when the button is depressed and turn it off otherwise.
- `intr.c` - respond to GPIO external interrupts (e.g., a button push).
- `timer.c` - a simple timer example using polling.
- `timer-intr.c` - use a timer to invoke an interrupt and change an LED.
` `pwm.c` - generate a PWM signal on PB4.
